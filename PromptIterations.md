# Prompt Engineering Iterations and Analysis

This document logs the development, testing, and refinement of prompts for the Sales AI Assistant (Gemini model). Use this table to compare prompt versions, AI outputs, and your analysis.

| Iteration | Prompt Version/Template | Scenario/Inputs | AI Output | Observations/Analysis | Changes for Next Iteration |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 1         |                        |                 |           |                      |                           |
| 2         |                        |                 |           |                      |                           |
| ...       |                        |                 |           |                      |                           |

## Reflection
- Which prompt strategies worked best and why?
- How did the AI handle objections, value propositions, and calls-to-action?
- What improvements were made over time?
